# OpenTelemetry common repository practices

This repository exists to document common reposiory practices used across OpenTelemetry, with a couple of
goals in mind:
* to help maintainers to discover new practices which are working for others and could help them as well
* to evolve these common practices over time with the input and learnings from everyone

Important: it is not a goal to document or describe anything here as "best practices", because there
is too much variation and nuance, and the OpenTelemetry project values the independence and
flexibility of individual repositories to define what is "best" for their respective communities.
