# OpenTelemetry SIG common practices

The goal of this repository is to document common practices used across OpenTelemetry SIGs, in order
to help SIGs discover practices which are working well for other SIGs, and could help them as well.

These are specifically NOT "best practices", because OpenTelemetry values the independence of
individual SIGs to define what is "best" for their respective contributor communities.
